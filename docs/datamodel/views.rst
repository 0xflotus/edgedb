Views
=====

A *view* is a named subset of an existing type defined by a query.  A
view can be referred to like a regular type in other expressions.
Views over queries that return objects essentially define a *view
subtype* of the original object type, which may have different
properties and links as may be specified by a *shape* in the view
expression.
