:index: link

Link items define a specific relationship between two object types.  Link
instances relate one *object* to one or more different objects.

There are two kinds of link item declarations: *abstract links*,
and *concrete links*.  Abstract links are defined on module level and are not
tied to any particular object type.  Concrete links are defined on specific
object types.
